        <h2> About Us </h2>
        <p>This website has been developed for the purpose of enriching economics curricula in high schools and universities. Students are encouraged to visualize the shifts associated with the economics concepts that they learn in their introduction and intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics classes. The graphs that can be studied are displayed in the tab under the respective class. Please explore the different graphs and play around with the different factors to see how shifts in the graphs affect things like price, quantity, efficiency, and revenue. We hope you benefit from this resource, and happy studying!</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
